# Portfolio React Project

This is a modern **React** portfolio project built using **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds. It leverages **Tailwind CSS** for styling, **Lucide Icons** for UI elements, and **Three.js** for potential 3D or interactive components.

## 📦 Project Structure

The project is structured using best practices with Vite, and includes:

- `index.html`: Entry point of the app
- `src/`: Source directory (React components, pages, assets)
- `public/`: Static files
- `dist/`: Build output (after running `npm run build`)

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- ⚛️ React JS for building UI components
- ⚡ Vite for lightning-fast development and HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- 🧩 ESLint integration with React and JSX support
- 🔧 Custom configuration using `vite.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js`
- 🧠 Three.js integration (3D effects or background animations)
- 🌐 Deployed output in `dist/` directory
